from dev.battery import Battery
from dev.electricvehicle import ElectricVehicle

from dev.load import Load
from profilesteering import ProfileSteering

# Initialisation
devices = []

# Settings
intervals = 96
desired_profile = [0] * intervals  # d in the PS paper
power_profile = [0] * intervals  # x in the PS paper

e_min = 0.001  # e_min in the PS paper
max_iters = 100  # maximum number of iterations

# Create the model:

# Add some baseloads
for i in range(0, 20):
    devices.append(Load())

# Add some batteries
for i in range(0, 20):
    devices.append(Battery())

# Add some EVs
for i in range(0, 20):
    devices.append(ElectricVehicle())

# Add some Heatpumps
for i in range(0, 20):
    devices.append(HeatPump())

# Run the Profile Steering algorithm
ps = ProfileSteering(devices)
power_profile = ps.init(desired_profile)
power_profile = ps.iterative(e_min, max_iters)

# And now power_profile has the result
# print("Resulting profile", power_profile)

# Tools like matplotlib let you plot this in a nice way
# Other tools may also have this available
